## Inspiration
There is no place where we can see the current scenario and future predictions of all the major stock exchanges. That is exactly what I've focused to solve.

## What it does
StocksHack predicts the future stock index points. All you have to do is select your stock exchange and select the date, and then you'll be able to see the predictions. The user can also see the 7 - day movement graph (including holidays) of Top 10 major stock exchanges to understand the market better and plan their next move. Then, StocksHack also has a page dedicated to latest news around the world, because I think that whatever happens in the world influences the market in its own way.

## How I built it
I built the frontend using HTML-CSS. For backend part, i majorly used flask (python's library) and for charts i used javascript library.

## Challenges I ran into
I don't have a commerce background. So I had to understand some basics of stock market and gather information that i put on my web application. Also, giving the website a professional look was quite challenging in itself.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I'm proud that I was able to make something in which i don't really have any expertise. And I'm also proud that StocksHack as a project has a really good future.

## What we learned
I learned a lot about Stock Markets, i also learned more about Flask and Heroku, and also about the UI designing aspect.

## What's next for StocksHack
I will make improvements, add features and then deploy this Web Application in real world market if God wills!
